# A fast and powerful way to build serverless apps with JS, Python, Ruby and .NET

**Architect is a toolkit for building serverless apps that are fast, modern, & MASSIVELY scalable.**

Architect helps you leverage powerful cloud services (such as **Amazon Web Services**) easily and quickly while letting you [develop locally and offline](/en/guides/tutorials/working-locally-and-offline).

- Organize your cloud infrastructure and HTTP routes with a [simple manifest](/en/reference/architect-project-structure)
- Implement [*cloud native* functions](/en/guides/tutorials/developing-with-cloud-functions) for versatile compute
- Leverage a [cloud-hosted database for data persistence](/en/guides/tutorials/modeling-and-persisting-data), querying and trigger functions
- Deliver [static assets](/en/reference/static-assets/static) fast with a [CDN](/en/reference/static-assets/cdn)
- Manage compute [tasks and asynchronous integrations](/en/guides/tutorials/background-tasks) with ready-to-go queuing, publish/subscribe and scheduling management
- Store sensitive information securely in the cloud using [environment variables](/en/reference/architect-manifest-and-config/environment-file)

[Architect is on a mission](/en/about/mission) to make building web apps free from infrastructure complexity and vendor cruft.
