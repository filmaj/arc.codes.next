## Mission

Architect is on a **mission** to make building web apps free from infrastructure complexity and vendor cruft. Our **goal** is to focus on the core business logic required to create value, ship only the code that matters, iterate faster and still enjoy unprecedented availability guarantees. Architect is a 100% **free and open source** project [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/architect), owned by the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) and [**governed transparently and collaboratively**](/en/about/governance) with its [community](/en/about/community/).

## Infrastructure as code

Architect defines a [high-level manifest file](/en/reference/architect-project-structure), in [multiple open formats](/en/reference/architect-manifest-and-config/project-manifest-and-config), and views cloud infrastructure as a build artifact.

- Focus on defining [app architecture with clear language in plain text](/en/reference/architect-project-structure)
- Generate code to [work locally and totally offline](/en/guides/tutorials/working-locally-and-offline)
- Implement your own infrastructure extensions with [macros](/en/reference/macros)
- The format, parser, and tooling are also all completely open to extension

> The Architect manifest is entirely portable between cloud vendors however no ports to clouds other than AWS have been made as of today
